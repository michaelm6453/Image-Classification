## Image Classification 

Simple data science / machine learning practice. <br>

Image preprocessing pipelines in PyTorch, compares CPU vs GPU speed differences for deep learning inference, used a pretrained ResNet18 to classify real-world images and then extracted the top-5 predictions with probabilities.
